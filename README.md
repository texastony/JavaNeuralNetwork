JavaNeuralNetwork
=================

Undergraduate Research Project, developing a neural network in Java with propagation. This code is an exploration of neural networks, so that the creator can then adapt it to Arduino to create an Independently Processed Neural Network on Arudino Pro Mini's for robotic control.
